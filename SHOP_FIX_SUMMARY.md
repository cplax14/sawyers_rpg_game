# Shop System Bug Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Shop Inventory Showing Empty
**Symptom:** Shop opens successfully but displays "This shop has no items available right now" even though shop data is loaded.

**Root Cause:** Race condition in data loading. The `ShopInterface` component was attempting to map shop inventory items to game items data before `useGameData()` had finished loading. The `isGameDataLoading` flag was retrieved but never used, causing the filtered items to return an empty array when `gameData.items` was still `undefined`.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/components/organisms/ShopInterface.tsx`:
  - Updated `filteredItems` memoized value to return `null` when data is still loading (line 311-313)
  - Added `isGameDataLoading` to the dependency array (line 385)
  - Updated render logic to show a loading state when `filteredItems === null` (lines 702-708)
  - Distinguished between "loading" (null), "no items" (empty array after filtering), and "has items" states

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before:
if (!gameData?.items || !state?.inventory) {
  return [];
}

// After:
if (isGameDataLoading) {
  return null;  // Distinguish loading from empty
}
if (!gameData?.items || !state?.inventory) {
  return [];
}

// UI Rendering:
{filteredItems === null ? (
  <div>‚è≥ Loading items...</div>
) : filteredItems.length === 0 ? (
  <div>üì¶ No items available</div>
) : (
  // Render items
)}
```

### Issue 2: Gold Display Showing 0 Instead of Actual Amount
**Symptom:** `GoldBalance` component displays 0 gold even though player has 628 gold.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect import path. The `GoldBalance` component was importing `useGameState` directly from `ReactGameContext.tsx` instead of using the proper hook from `hooks/useGameState.ts`. This caused it to access a different context or an improperly configured context.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/components/atoms/GoldBalance.tsx`:
  - Changed import from `../../contexts/ReactGameContext` to `../../hooks/useGameState` (line 3)
  - This ensures the component uses the properly configured context hook that correctly accesses player data

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before:
import { useGameState } from '../../contexts/ReactGameContext';

// After:
import { useGameState } from '../../hooks/useGameState';
```

## Additional Cleanup

### Removed Debug Logging
Removed temporary debug console.log statements added during investigation from:
- `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/hooks/useShop.ts` (lines 177-210 cleaned up)
- `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/utils/shopSystem.ts` (filterShopInventory function simplified)
- `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/components/atoms/GoldBalance.tsx` (debug logging removed)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Shop Inventory Loading:**
   - Open shop from Peaceful Village (mistwood_general_store)
   - Verify that items load correctly after a brief loading indicator
   - Confirm level 1 player sees appropriate items (health_potion, mana_potion, rope, torch)
   - Confirm level 2+ items (antidote) are filtered out for level 1 player

2. **Gold Display:**
   - Verify gold amount displays correctly in shop interface
   - Test gold display in breeding screen
   - Confirm gold updates properly after transactions

3. **Loading States:**
   - Test shop loading on slower connections or with artificially delayed data loading
   - Verify loading indicator appears briefly before items load
   - Confirm no flash of "empty" message during loading

## Files Modified

1. `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/components/organisms/ShopInterface.tsx`
2. `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/components/atoms/GoldBalance.tsx`
3. `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/hooks/useShop.ts`
4. `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/utils/shopSystem.ts`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Shop Opens:** Console shows "Opening shop: mistwood_general_store" ‚úì
2. **Shop Inventory:** Displays items appropriate for player's level with brief loading indicator
3. **Gold Display:** Shows correct player gold amount (e.g., 628 instead of 0)
4. **Smooth UX:** No confusing empty states, clear loading feedback

## Technical Notes

- The fix properly handles async data loading by distinguishing between three states:
  - `null`: Data is still loading
  - `[]` (empty array): No items match filters
  - `[...items]`: Items available to display

- The `useGameState` hook in `/home/josh/Documents/projects/personal/react_port_for_sawyers_rpg_game/src/hooks/useGameState.ts` is the canonical way to access game state throughout the application

- Shop inventory filtering logic remains unchanged and working correctly - the issue was purely in timing/async handling
