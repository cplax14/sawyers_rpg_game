# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "Sawyer's RPG Game" - a role-playing game project currently in its initial stages. The repository contains only basic setup files and appears to be a fresh Python-based game project.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently minimal with only:
- README.md: Basic project description
- .gitignore: Comprehensive Python gitignore configuration
- Git repository initialized

## Development Setup

This appears to be a Python-based project based on the .gitignore configuration which includes Python-specific exclusions for:
- Virtual environments (.venv, venv/, etc.)
- Python bytecode (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
- Testing artifacts (.pytest_cache/, coverage files)
- Various Python package managers (pip, poetry, pdm, uv)

## Current Status

This is a new project with no source code yet implemented. Future development will likely involve:
- Setting up Python project structure
- Implementing game mechanics and logic
- Adding tests and documentation as the project grows

## Notes

- The project uses a comprehensive Python .gitignore suggesting it will be a Python-based RPG game
- No specific build, test, or lint commands are available yet as no project files exist
- Development tooling and dependencies will need to be established as the project grows
