# Task List: Combat Animation System

Generated from: `docs/prd-combat-animation-system.md`

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ Magic Bolt animation already implemented in `src/components/combat/animations/`
- ✅ Core animation components exist: `ChargeParticles.tsx`, `Projectile.tsx`, `ImpactEffects.tsx`, `types.ts`
- ✅ Combat system in `Combat.tsx` has animation integration for Magic Bolt
- ✅ Framer Motion library already in use
- ✅ Spell data defined in `public/data/spells.js` with element types and properties

### Architecture Patterns
- Component-based React architecture with TypeScript
- Modular animation components that compose together
- Phase-based animation structure (charge → cast → travel → impact → aftermath)
- Animation triggered from Combat.tsx during battle flow

### Notes
- No unit tests required initially per PRD scope (focus on implementation first)
- All components use TypeScript with strict mode
- Components should be memoized with `React.memo` for performance
- Use GPU-accelerated properties only (`transform`, `opacity`)
- Target 60fps on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
