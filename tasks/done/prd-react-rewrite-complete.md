# Product Requirements Document: Complete React Rewrite of Sawyer's RPG Game

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the complete rewrite of Sawyer's RPG Game from a hybrid React-vanilla JavaScript architecture to a pure React application. The current implementation suffers from event handling conflicts, timing issues, and architectural complexity due to mixing two UI paradigms. A clean React rewrite will provide better maintainability, modern development patterns, and enhanced user experience while preserving all existing game functionality.

The goal is to create a fresh, modern RPG game interface that maintains the core game mechanics while providing improved responsiveness, visual polish, and long-term extensibility.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Architecture Complexity**: Replace hybrid React-vanilla JS system with clean React architecture
2. **Improve User Experience**: Enhanced responsive design, animations, and accessibility
3. **Establish Scalable Foundation**: Modern state management and component library for future features
4. **Maintain Game Integrity**: Preserve all existing RPG mechanics and progression systems
5. **Enable Future Growth**: Cloud saves, multiple save slots, and expandable game systems

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a player**, I want to smoothly navigate between game screens without timing issues or visual glitches
- **As a player**, I want character selection to work reliably with visual feedback and enhanced class previews
- **As a player**, I want an immersive world map that's easy to navigate with zoom, pan, and interactive tooltips
- **As a player**, I want my game progress saved reliably with multiple save slots and cloud backup options
- **As a mobile user**, I want the game to work seamlessly on different screen sizes and devices

### Developer User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want a single, consistent architecture that's easy to debug and extend
- **As a developer**, I want TypeScript support and modern tooling for better code quality
- **As a developer**, I want clear component boundaries and reusable UI elements

## Functional Requirements

   - Improved loading states and progress indicators

6. **Save System Improvements**
   - Cloud save integration for cross-device play
   - Multiple save slots with metadata (character, progress, timestamp)
   - Robust error handling and save validation
   - Import/export functionality for save data

### Data Architecture
7. **Game Data Structure**
   - Redesigned data organization optimized for React patterns
   - TypeScript interfaces for all game entities (characters, areas, items, etc.)
   - Centralized data management with clear API patterns
   - Improved data validation and error handling

8. **State Management**
   - React Context-based state management for UI and game state
   - Clear separation of concerns between UI state and game logic
   - Optimized re-rendering patterns for performance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Phase 1 Exclusions
- Combat system implementation (will be added in Phase 2)
- Monster management interface (Phase 2)
- Inventory system (Phase 2)
- Story/dialogue system (Phase 2)
- Settings interface (Phase 2)
- Multiplayer functionality
- Real-time features or live updates
- Native mobile app development (web-based only)

### Permanent Exclusions
- Backward compatibility with vanilla JS version
- Support for legacy save formats (will provide migration tool)
- Internet Explorer support

## Design Considerations

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Principles**: Build reusable component library (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
- **Fantasy Aesthetic**: Maintain existing medieval/fantasy visual theme with enhanced polish
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with React.memo and proper state management

### Visual Design Requirements
- **Consistent Theming**: CSS custom properties for colors, typography, spacing
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and smooth loading transitions

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for complex state
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components with CSS custom properties
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for UI animations
- **Build Tool**: Vite (already configured)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests

### Integration Points
- **Game Engine**: Preserve existing game logic as separate modules
- **Data Layer**: Clean API layer between React UI and game systems
- **Save System**: IndexedDB for local storage, API integration for cloud saves
- **Asset Management**: Optimized image loading and caching strategies

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load**: Under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps for all UI transitions
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient component unmounting and state cleanup
- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting for optimal loading

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Zero hybrid architecture issues**: No React-vanilla JS timing conflicts
- **100% functional parity**: All Phase 1 features work reliably
- **Improved performance**: Faster screen transitions and reduced memory usage
- **Code maintainability**: Clear component structure and TypeScript coverage

### User Experience Metrics
- **Character selection success rate**: 100% reliable class selection
- **World map usability**: Users can successfully navigate and interact with areas
- **Mobile compatibility**: Functional on all target device sizes
- **Save system reliability**: Zero data loss incidents

### Development Metrics
- **Faster feature development**: Reduced time to implement new UI features
- **Easier debugging**: Clear error messages and component isolation
- **Better testing coverage**: Unit tests for all critical UI components

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Timeline (4-6 weeks)
**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up new component architecture and design system
- Create reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
- Implement core routing and navigation

**Week 3-4: Core Screens**
- Rebuild Main Menu with enhanced styling
- Implement new Character Selection with previews and animations
- Create interactive World Map interface

**Week 5-6: Polish & Integration**
- Add responsive design and mobile support
- Implement save system improvements
- Testing, bug fixes, and performance optimization

### Migration Strategy
- **Clean Slate Approach**: Build new React components from scratch
- **Data Preservation**: Maintain existing game data structure initially, refactor gradually
- **Feature Parity**: Ensure Phase 1 features match or exceed current functionality
- **User Migration**: Provide save data migration tools

## Open Questions

1. **Cloud Save Provider**: Which service should we integrate for cloud saves? (Firebase, AWS, custom backend?)
2. **Animation Complexity**: How elaborate should the character selection animations be?
3. **Mobile Controls**: Should we add swipe gestures for world map navigation?
4. **Accessibility Priority**: What level of accessibility features should be implemented in Phase 1?
5. **Testing Strategy**: Should we implement E2E tests in addition to unit tests?
6. **Performance Budget**: What are the specific performance targets for different devices?

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Planning**: Design detailed component hierarchy and state structure
2. **Design System**: Create visual design specification and component library
3. **Technical Spike**: Prototype key interactions (character selection, world map)
4. **Development Environment**: Set up TypeScript, testing, and development tooling
5. **Project Setup**: Create development branches and establish code review process
