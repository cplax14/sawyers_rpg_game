### Notes

- The codebase already has a sophisticated local save system with `useSaveSystem` hook and `SaveLoadManager` component
- Current architecture uses React hooks pattern and is well-structured for adding cloud features
- Need to integrate cloud authentication and storage without breaking existing local save functionality
- Auto-save system needs to be implemented as a separate concern that works with existing manual save system
