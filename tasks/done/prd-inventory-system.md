# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Inventory System and Progress Tracking

## Introduction/Overview

The Comprehensive Inventory System and Progress Tracking feature addresses the current gap in player character management by providing a centralized hub where players can view and manage their equipment, track character progression, organize consumable items, and manage their creature collection. This feature solves the problem of players being unable to see their complete character status, progression, and inventory in an organized, accessible manner.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive, comprehensive inventory and character management system that enhances player engagement and provides clear visibility into character progression and item management.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Character Management:** Provide a single interface where players can view all aspects of their character (equipment, stats, progression, items)
2. **Improved Item Management:** Enable efficient organization and use of equipment, consumables, and collectibles
3. **Enhanced Progress Visibility:** Show detailed character progression including XP breakdown, leveling history, and achievement tracking
4. **Creature Collection Hub:** Provide a comprehensive bestiary and creature management system
5. **Seamless Gameplay Integration:** Ensure inventory access doesn't disrupt gameplay flow while maintaining balance

## User Stories

1. **Equipment Management:**
   - As a player, I want to easily compare my current equipment with new items I find so that I can make informed decisions about upgrades
   - As a player, I want to quickly equip better gear with simple clicks and confirmations so that I don't waste time in menus during exploration

2. **Progress Tracking:**
   - As a player, I want to see my detailed XP breakdown by activity so that I understand how different actions contribute to my progression
   - As a player, I want to view my complete leveling history and statistics so that I can track my character's growth over time

3. **Inventory Organization:**
   - As a player, I want my consumable items grouped by type with clear quantity indicators so that I can quickly find and use what I need
   - As a player, I want to use health and mana potions directly from my inventory so that I can recover during exploration

4. **Creature Collection:**
   - As a player, I want to view my captured creatures like a bestiary with stats and lore so that I can learn about the game world
   - As a player, I want to manage my creature collection (release, use in combat, trade, breed) so that I can optimize my strategy

34. The system must support keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time Inventory Sharing:** No live inventory sharing with other players during gameplay
2. **Item Crafting System:** Crafting mechanics will be handled by a separate system
3. **Merchant/Trading Interface:** Buy/sell functionality will be part of a separate commerce system
4. **Guild/Party Inventory:** Shared inventory systems for groups will not be included
5. **Item Durability System:** Equipment degradation mechanics are out of scope for this feature
6. **Advanced Creature AI:** Complex creature behavior programming beyond basic combat assistance

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Equipment Screen:** Paper doll character view with equipment slots surrounding the character model
- **Stats Screen:** Character progression dashboard with XP graphs, level timeline, and achievement showcase
- **Items Screen:** Grid-based inventory with category tabs and search functionality
- **Creatures Screen:** Card gallery with creature portraits, expandable details, and collection progress indicators

### User Experience
- **Navigation:** Clear breadcrumb navigation and consistent back/forward buttons
- **Feedback:** Visual and audio feedback for all actions (equipping items, using consumables, leveling up)
- **Accessibility:** Support for colorblind-friendly indicators and keyboard navigation
- **Performance:** Lazy loading for large creature collections and inventory items

## Technical Considerations

### Data Management
- **State Management:** Integration with existing Redux/Context state management for character data
- **Persistence:** All inventory changes must be saved to the existing save system
- **Performance:** Efficient rendering for large inventories (virtualization for 1000+ items)
- **Caching:** Smart caching of creature data and item statistics

### Integration Points
- **Combat System:** Creature combat integration for companion/summon mechanics
- **Save System:** Complete integration with existing local and cloud save functionality
- **Achievement System:** Hook into existing achievement tracking for collection milestones
- **Game Balance:** Ensure consumable usage restrictions align with combat balance

### Data Structures
- **Inventory Schema:** Extend existing game state to include detailed item categorization
- **Creature Database:** Implement efficient creature data storage with breeding lineage tracking
- **Experience Tracking:** Enhanced XP logging with activity source attribution

## Open Questions

1. **Creature Breeding Complexity:** What level of genetic inheritance should creature breeding include? (Simple trait mixing vs. complex genetic algorithms)
- Let's start with simple trait mixing
2. **Collection Size Limits:** Should there be maximum limits on creature collection or inventory size? If so, what should trigger expansion?
- Let's start with no limits
3. **Cross-Platform Synchronization:** How should creature trading work if implementing cross-platform play in the future?
- Let's start with no cross-platform play
4. **Offline Functionality:** What inventory features should remain accessible when cloud save is unavailable?
- Let's start with no offline functionality
5. **Achievement Integration:** Which specific collection milestones should trigger achievements or rewards?
- Let's start with no achievements
6. **Creature Combat Balance:** How should creature companions be balanced to enhance rather than replace player combat skills?
- Creatures should start the game with being weaker than the player, but by the end of the game, creatures should be much stronger than the player. 
7. **Item Rarity Indicators:** What visual system should distinguish common, rare, epic, and legendary items in inventory views?
- Let's use colors to denote rarity. Common items should be green, rare items should be blue, epic items should be purple, and legendary items should be orange.
8. **Bulk Operations:** Should players be able to perform bulk actions (mass release creatures, bulk consume potions) and with what safeguards?
- Let's start with no bulk operations
