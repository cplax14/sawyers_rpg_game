# Product Requirements Document: Codebase Refactoring and Modularization

## Introduction/Overview

The Sawyer's RPG Game codebase has grown significantly during development, with several files (particularly `js/ui.js` at ~3000+ lines) becoming unwieldy and difficult to maintain. This refactoring initiative aims to break up large files into smaller, focused modules while improving code organization, maintainability, and developer experience. The primary goal is to create a more modular architecture that's easier for new developers to understand and contribute to, while fixing existing technical debt in the process.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Break up oversized files (especially `js/ui.js`) into smaller, focused modules of 200-500 lines each
2. **Maintainability**: Improve code organization and separation of concerns to make the codebase easier to understand and modify
3. **Developer Experience**: Create a structure that allows new developers to quickly locate and understand specific functionality
4. **Technical Debt**: Address existing architectural issues and inconsistencies discovered during development
5. **Future-Proofing**: Establish patterns and conventions that will scale as new features are added

## User Stories

1. **As a new developer**, I want to be able to quickly understand how the UI system works by looking at focused, single-responsibility modules rather than one massive file.

2. **As a maintainer**, I want to be able to modify settings functionality without having to navigate through combat, world map, and other unrelated UI code.

3. **As a developer adding new features**, I want clear patterns for where to add new UI components and how they should integrate with the existing system.

4. **As a code reviewer**, I want to be able to review changes to specific UI areas without having to understand the entire UI system.

5. **As a developer debugging issues**, I want to be able to quickly locate the relevant code for a specific screen or functionality without searching through thousands of lines.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. UI.js Modularization
1.1. **Break up `js/ui.js`** into the following modules:
   - `js/ui/UIManager.js` - Core UI management and scene coordination (200-300 lines)
   - `js/ui/MenuUI.js` - Main menu, character selection, and navigation (200-300 lines)
   - `js/ui/GameWorldUI.js` - World map, area selection, and exploration UI (300-400 lines)
   - `js/ui/CombatUI.js` - Combat interface, actions, and battle management (300-400 lines)
   - `js/ui/MonsterUI.js` - Monster management, breeding, and storage interfaces (300-400 lines)
   - `js/ui/InventoryUI.js` - Inventory, equipment, and item management (200-300 lines)
   - `js/ui/SettingsUI.js` - Settings panels, controls, and preferences (400-500 lines)
   - `js/ui/StoryUI.js` - Story modal, dialogue, and narrative interfaces (150-200 lines)
   - `js/ui/UIHelpers.js` - Shared utilities, notifications, and common UI functions (150-200 lines)

1.2. **Maintain single UIManager entry point** that imports and coordinates all UI modules

1.3. **Preserve all existing functionality** - no behavioral changes during refactoring

1.4. **Implement consistent module interfaces** with standardized init(), attach(), update(), and cleanup() methods

### 2. CSS Organization
2.1. **Split large CSS files** if they exceed 2000 lines
2.2. **Group related styles** by component/screen in separate files
2.3. **Maintain existing visual appearance** during refactoring

### 3. Documentation and Conventions
3.1. **Add module documentation** explaining purpose and responsibilities of each UI module
3.2. **Document module interfaces** and how they communicate with UIManager
3.3. **Create coding conventions** document for future development
3.4. **Add inline comments** explaining complex interactions between modules

### 4. Testing Integration
4.1. **Update existing tests** to work with new module structure
4.2. **Create module-specific test files** where appropriate
4.3. **Ensure all validation tests** continue to pass after refactoring

### 5. Technical Debt Resolution
5.1. **Remove duplicate code** discovered during modularization
5.2. **Standardize event handling patterns** across UI modules
5.3. **Improve error handling** and logging consistency
5.4. **Fix inconsistent naming conventions** found during refactoring

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **No functional changes** - this is purely a structural refactoring, not a feature enhancement
2. **No UI/UX redesign** - maintain exact same user interface and behavior
3. **No performance optimization** - focus is on maintainability, not performance
4. **No framework migration** - stay with vanilla JavaScript approach
5. **No major architectural changes** - preserve existing game loop and state management patterns
6. **No other large file refactoring** in this phase - focus on UI.js first, tackle others later

## Design Considerations

### Module Structure
- Each UI module should be a class that extends or works with the main UIManager
- Use consistent constructor patterns: `constructor(uiManager, gameState)`
- Implement standard lifecycle methods: `init()`, `attachEvents()`, `show()`, `hide()`, `cleanup()`
- Modules should communicate through UIManager rather than directly with each other

### File Organization
```
js/
├── ui/
│   ├── UIManager.js          (main coordinator)
│   ├── MenuUI.js            (main menu, character select)
│   ├── GameWorldUI.js       (world map, travel)
│   ├── CombatUI.js          (battle interface)
│   ├── MonsterUI.js         (monster management)
│   ├── InventoryUI.js       (items, equipment)
│   ├── SettingsUI.js        (game settings)
│   ├── StoryUI.js           (narrative interface)
│   └── UIHelpers.js         (shared utilities)
├── ui.js                    (legacy - to be deprecated)
└── [other existing files]
```

### Import Strategy
- Use ES6 modules where possible, fall back to script loading order for compatibility
- UIManager imports all modules and instantiates them
- Each module exports a single class or object
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Must work with existing game.js, gameState.js, and data modules
- Should integrate seamlessly with current HTML structure
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CSS classes and IDs
- Should work with current testing framework

### Migration Strategy
- Keep original ui.js file during development for fallback
- Implement new modular system alongside existing code
- Test each module individually before integration
- Switch to new system only after full validation
- Remove old ui.js file in final cleanup step

### Error Handling
- Each module should handle its own errors gracefully
- UIManager should catch and log module-level errors
- Maintain existing error notification system
- Add module-specific error logging for debugging

### Browser Compatibility
- Maintain current browser support (modern browsers with ES6+ support)
- Ensure module loading works in development and testing environments
- Consider build step for production bundling if needed in future

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **File Size Reduction**: No single UI-related file should exceed 500 lines of code
2. **Module Count**: Create 8-9 focused UI modules from the single large ui.js file
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% of existing test pass rate after refactoring
4. **Code Duplication**: Reduce duplicate code by at least 15% through shared utilities

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **Developer Onboarding**: New developers can locate specific UI functionality within 2 minutes
2. **Code Review Efficiency**: UI-related code reviews can focus on specific modules rather than entire system
3. **Maintenance Ease**: UI bugs can be isolated to specific modules for faster debugging
4. **Future Development**: New UI features have clear integration patterns and locations

### Validation Criteria
1. All existing functionality works identically to before refactoring
2. All existing tests pass without modification (except imports/paths)
3. Code is easier to navigate (measured by developer feedback)
4. No performance regression in UI responsiveness
5. Memory usage remains equivalent or improves

## Open Questions

1. **Module Communication**: Should modules communicate through events, direct method calls via UIManager, or a combination of both?

2. **State Management**: Should each UI module maintain its own state, or should all state remain in GameState with modules being stateless?

3. **Testing Strategy**: Should we create separate test files for each UI module, or keep the existing monolithic test approach?

4. **Build Process**: Do we need to introduce a build step for module bundling, or continue with direct script loading?

5. **CSS Splitting**: Should CSS be split to match the JS module structure (e.g., MenuUI.css, CombatUI.css), or keep the existing unified approach?

6. **Backward Compatibility**: How long should we maintain the old ui.js file as a fallback before completely removing it?

7. **Documentation Location**: Should module documentation live in the code files, separate markdown files, or both?
