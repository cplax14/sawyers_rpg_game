### Notes

- The inventory system integrates with existing game state management through `src/contexts/ReactGameContext.tsx`
- Equipment and creature combat integration will require coordination with existing `src/components/organisms/Combat.tsx`
- All inventory changes must integrate with the existing save system in `src/utils/saveSystemManager.ts`
- Creature breeding and trading features will be implemented as basic functionality without complex genetics initially
- Item rarity will use color coding: Common (green), Rare (blue), Epic (purple), Legendary (orange)
