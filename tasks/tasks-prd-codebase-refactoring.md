### Notes

- The current `js/ui.js` file is 4504 lines long and handles all UI responsibilities
- Existing test files like `validate_world_map.js`, `validate_inventory.js`, and `validate_settings.js` will need updates for new module structure
- The game uses vanilla JavaScript with script loading, so module loading strategy needs to maintain compatibility
- All existing functionality must be preserved during refactoring - no behavioral changes allowed
