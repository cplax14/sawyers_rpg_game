# Tasks for Codebase Refactoring and Modularization

## Relevant Files

- `js/ui/UIManager.js` - Main UI coordinator and module management (to be created)
- `js/ui/MenuUI.js` - Main menu, character selection, and navigation interfaces (to be created)
- `js/ui/GameWorldUI.js` - World map, area selection, travel, and exploration UI (to be created)
- `js/ui/CombatUI.js` - Combat interface, actions, battle management, and targeting (to be created)
- `js/ui/MonsterUI.js` - Monster management, breeding, storage, and party interfaces (to be created)
- `js/ui/InventoryUI.js` - Inventory, equipment, item management, and trading (to be created)
- `js/ui/SettingsUI.js` - Settings panels, controls, preferences, and configuration (to be created)
- `js/ui/StoryUI.js` - Story modal, dialogue, narrative interfaces, and choices (to be created)
- `js/ui/UIHelpers.js` - Shared utilities, notifications, common UI functions, and helpers (to be created)
- `js/ui.js` - Current monolithic UI file (~4500 lines) to be refactored and eventually deprecated
- `tests/ui_modules.test.js` - Integration tests for new modular UI system (to be created)
- `tests/validate_ui_refactoring.js` - Validation tests to ensure functionality preservation (to be created)
- `index.html` - Main HTML file that will need script loading updates for new modules
- `docs/ui-module-conventions.md` - Documentation for UI module patterns and conventions (to be created)

### Notes

- The current `js/ui.js` file is 4504 lines long and handles all UI responsibilities
- Existing test files like `validate_world_map.js`, `validate_inventory.js`, and `validate_settings.js` will need updates for new module structure
- The game uses vanilla JavaScript with script loading, so module loading strategy needs to maintain compatibility
- All existing functionality must be preserved during refactoring - no behavioral changes allowed
