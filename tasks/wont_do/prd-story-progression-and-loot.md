# Product Requirements Document: Story Area Progression with Loot & Spell Systems

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances Sawyer's RPG Game by implementing a comprehensive progression system that addresses three core gameplay pillars: meaningful area progression through branching story paths, rewarding loot collection from combat encounters, and strategic spell casting mechanics. The system solves multiple player experience issues including feeling stuck without clear progression paths, repetitive combat lacking meaningful rewards, and limited strategic depth in battle encounters.

## Goals

1. **Enable Branching Story Progression**: Implement a flexible area unlock system based on story events, player levels, items, and boss victories
2. **Create Rewarding Loot Systems**: Establish tiered, level-scaled loot drops from monsters including equipment, consumables, and spell materials
3. **Add Strategic Combat Depth**: Integrate mana-based spell casting with class-specific abilities into the existing combat system
4. **Improve Player Retention**: Provide clear progression incentives and meaningful choices throughout the game
5. **Enhance Replay Value**: Support multiple story paths with different unlocking conditions and rewards

## User Stories

- **As a player**, I want to learn new spells through multiple methods so that character growth feels varied and rewarding

## Functional Requirements

### Area Progression System
1. **The system must support branching story paths** where players can unlock different areas based on their choices and achievements
2. **Area unlocking must check multiple criteria** including specific story flags, minimum player level, required inventory items, and defeated bosses
3. **The system must provide clear progression indicators** showing players what requirements they've met and what's still needed
4. **Area connections must be validated** to ensure players can only access areas that are logically reachable from their current location
5. **The system must track story branch choices** and maintain consistency across the player's chosen narrative path
6. **New area unlocks must provide appropriate notifications** to inform players of newly available content

### Loot Collection System
7. **Monsters must drop loot based on tiered rarity system** (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary) with appropriate drop rates
8. **Loot drops must scale with monster and player levels** to ensure rewards remain relevant throughout progression
9. **The system must support all loot types**: consumable items, weapons, armor, accessories, crafting materials, gold, and spell learning materials
10. **Each area must have specific loot tables** that define what items can drop from monsters in that region
11. **Drop rates must vary by monster rarity and type** with stronger/rarer monsters having better loot chances
12. **The system must handle inventory management** when players receive new loot, including overflow scenarios

### Spell Casting System
13. **Combat must support mana-based spell casting** where spells consume MP and players must manage this resource strategically
14. **Each character class must have unique spell sets** that define their magical abilities and combat role
15. **Spell learning must support multiple acquisition methods**: automatic on level up, loot drops, NPC purchases, and quest rewards
16. **The system must integrate with existing combat mechanics** without disrupting current battle flow
17. **Spells must have varied effects**: damage, healing, buffs, debuffs, and utility effects
18. **MP regeneration must be balanced** to encourage strategic use without making spells trivial

### Integration Requirements
19. **The system must extend current story flag functionality** for area progression tracking
20. **Loot integration must work with existing inventory system** and support new item types seamlessly
21. **Spell system must integrate with current combat engine** and support both player and monster spell casting
22. **All systems must work together cohesively** so area progression can unlock new loot and spells

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time combat system** - maintaining turn-based combat mechanics
2. **Multiplayer progression** - focusing on single-player experience only
3. **Crafting system implementation** - collecting materials but not crafting mechanics in this iteration
4. **Voice acting or cutscenes** - text-based story progression only
5. **Advanced AI spell casting** - basic monster spell usage only
6. **Equipment enchanting/upgrading** - base equipment system only
7. **Guild or faction systems** - individual player progression only

## Technical Considerations

### System Integration
- **Story progression must extend `GameState.world.storyFlags`** and area unlocking logic in `AreaData`
- **Loot system must enhance `MonsterData` with drop tables** and integrate with `GameState.player.inventory`
- **Spell system must extend `CharacterData` classes** and integrate with `CombatEngine` for MP management
- **Save system must preserve** all new progression, loot, and spell data across game sessions

### Performance Considerations
- **Loot generation should be efficient** and not impact combat performance
- **Area unlock checks should be optimized** to avoid unnecessary calculations on every story flag change
- **Spell effect calculations must be performant** during combat encounters

### Data Structure Requirements
- **Area progression data must support complex unlock conditions** with AND/OR logic for requirements
- **Loot tables must be flexible and moddable** for future content expansion
- **Spell data must include MP costs, effects, and learning requirements** in a scalable format

## Success Metrics

### Player Retention & Engagement
- **Increase player session length by 25%** through compelling progression rewards
- **Achieve 80%+ completion rate** for first story branch unlock
- **Maintain 90%+ save file continuation rate** indicating players want to keep progressing

### Combat & Strategy Metrics
- **75% of players should use spells regularly** (at least once per 3 combat encounters)
- **Average combat duration should increase by 15%** indicating more strategic thinking
- **Equipment upgrade rate should be 2+ items per area** showing meaningful loot progression

### Story Progression Metrics
- **At least 60% replay rate** for different story branches
- **Track completion rates for each story path** to identify popular and problematic routes
- **Monitor story choice distribution** to ensure branching paths are discovered and chosen

### Technical Performance
- **Loot generation must complete within 100ms** per combat encounter
- **Area unlock calculations must complete within 50ms** per story flag change
- **Spell casting must not add more than 200ms** to combat action processing

## Open Questions

1. **Should spell scrolls be consumable** or reusable learning items?
2. **How many story branches should we implement initially** - 2-3 major paths or more granular choices?
3. **Should certain rare items be guaranteed drops from specific bosses** or always RNG-based?
4. **What should happen if a player's inventory is full when receiving loot** - auto-discard, force choice, or expand inventory?
5. **Should there be a maximum MP pool** or should it scale infinitely with level?
6. **How should area progression handle players who might want to skip story content** - alternative unlock methods or enforced narrative flow?
7. **Should loot rarity be visually distinct** in the UI and inventory system?
8. **What's the desired balance between automatic spell learning vs. player choice** for spell acquisition?

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Area Progression Foundation**
- Implement branching story path logic
- Create area unlock condition checking
- Add progression indicators and notifications

**Phase 2: Loot System Development**
- Design and implement tiered rarity system
- Create monster-specific drop tables
- Integrate with inventory and equipment systems

**Phase 3: Spell Casting Integration**
- Add MP system to combat engine
- Implement class-specific spell sets
- Create multiple spell learning pathways

This phased approach ensures each system is solid before building the next layer, reducing integration complexity and allowing for iterative testing and refinement.
