# Product Requirements Document: Complete React Port of Sawyer's RPG Game

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the complete conversion of Sawyer's RPG Game from vanilla JavaScript to a modern React-based application. The goal is to enhance the user experience with modern UI capabilities, better animations, and improved developer productivity while preserving the core game mechanics that Sawyer enjoys: monster capturing/breeding, story choices, and dynamic combat with spell animations.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 infrastructure has been completed, including React setup, TypeScript configuration, hybrid architecture, and communication bridge between React and vanilla JS.

## Goals

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Create a more polished, modern interface with smooth animations and intuitive interactions
2. **Improved Combat System**: Add visual animations for attacks, spells, and combat actions
3. **Better Monster Management**: Streamlined UI for capturing, breeding, and managing monsters
4. **Enhanced Story System**: Rich dialogue interface with better choice presentation
5. **Developer Productivity**: Faster feature development with React's component architecture
6. **Modern Feel**: Contemporary interface that feels responsive and engaging

## User Stories

### Core Player Experience
- **As Sawyer**, I want to see my attacks and spells animate during combat so that battles feel more exciting and engaging
- **As Sawyer**, I want an intuitive monster breeding interface so that I can easily experiment with creating new monster combinations
- **As a player**, I want story choices to be presented clearly with visual consequences so that I can make informed decisions
- **As a player**, I want the inventory system to be easy to navigate so that I can quickly find and use items during gameplay

### Enhanced Interactions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### What We Will NOT Do:
1. **Multiplayer Features**: This remains a single-player experience
2. **Platform Porting**: Focus stays on web browser implementation
3. **Monetization**: No in-app purchases or premium features
4. **Social Features**: No sharing, leaderboards, or social integration
5. **Mobile App**: Web-responsive design only, no native mobile app
6. **Backend Services**: Continue using local storage for save data

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design Principles
- **Maintain Fantasy Theme**: Preserve the existing color palette and medieval fantasy aesthetic
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps animations for combat and UI transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure compatibility across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Animation Guidelines
- **Combat Animations**: 0.5-1.5 second duration for attack/spell effects
- **UI Transitions**: 0.2-0.3 second duration for screen changes
- **Particle Effects**: Lightweight, performant effects that don't impact gameplay
- **Feedback Loops**: Visual confirmation for all user actions within 100ms

### Component Architecture
- **Reusable Components**: Button, Modal, Card, ProgressBar, AnimatedSprite
- **Game-Specific Components**: CombatArena, MonsterCard, SpellEffect, DialogueBox
- **Layout Components**: GameScreen, TabContainer, GridLayout, ResponsiveContainer

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **State Management**: Continue using React Context API for simplicity
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion for smooth, declarative animations
- **Asset Management**: Vite's asset pipeline for optimized loading
- **Performance**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive render operations

### Integration Points
- **Existing Game Engine**: Maintain communication through established vanillaBridge
- **Save System**: Ensure React UI changes don't break existing save/load functionality
- **Asset Compatibility**: All existing sprites, sounds, and data files remain unchanged
- **Testing**: Update test suite to include React component testing

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 2A** (Weeks 1-3): Combat animations and visual feedback
2. **Phase 2B** (Weeks 4-6): Monster management UI overhaul
3. **Phase 2C** (Weeks 7-8): Story system enhancement
4. **Phase 2D** (Weeks 9-10): Interactive world map
5. **Phase 2E** (Weeks 11-12): Inventory system improvements
6. **Phase 2F** (Weeks 13-14): Settings and polish

## Open Questions

1. **Animation Asset Creation**: Should we create new sprite-based animations or use CSS/SVG animations for spell effects?
2. **Performance Constraints**: What's the target minimum hardware spec for smooth 60fps animations?
3. **Save Data Migration**: Do we need to provide migration tools for existing save files when UI changes affect data structure?
4. **Accessibility Features**: Are there specific accessibility needs we should prioritize (colorblind support, motor disabilities, etc.)?
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Should we maintain IE11 support or focus on modern browsers only?

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Already Completed (Phase 1)
- ✅ React + TypeScript + Vite setup
- ✅ Hybrid architecture with vanilla JS game engine
- ✅ Communication bridge (vanillaBridge)
- ✅ Basic React components (MainMenu, GameHUD)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure

### Required for Phase 2
- Framer Motion animation library
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Additional TypeScript definitions for animation types
- Performance monitoring tools
- Accessibility testing tools

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Complex animations might affect game performance on older devices
- **Scope Creep**: Feature enhancement requests during development
- **Integration Complexity**: Ensuring React animations don't conflict with vanilla JS game logic

### Medium Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Different animation performance across browsers
- **Asset Loading**: Large animation assets affecting initial load time
- **User Acceptance**: Sawyer might prefer simpler, faster interactions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Performance budgets and regular testing on target hardware
- Phased rollout with ability to disable animations
- Fallback options for users with performance constraints
- Regular user feedback sessions with Sawyer during development

**Next Steps**: Upon approval of this PRD, begin Phase 2A implementation starting with combat animation foundation and basic spell effects.
