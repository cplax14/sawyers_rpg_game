# Product Requirements Document: Save System with Cloud Storage

## Introduction/Overview

The save system will provide players with reliable ways to preserve their game progress both locally and in the cloud. This feature addresses the critical problem of players losing progress when closing their browser, switching devices, or experiencing technical issues. The system will support both manual and automatic saving, with 3-5 save slots per player, and integrate with a Database-as-a-Service solution for cloud backup and restore functionality.

**Goal:** Ensure players never lose their game progress while providing convenient backup and restore capabilities through cloud storage.

## Goals

1. **Prevent Progress Loss:** Eliminate player frustration from lost progress due to browser issues, device changes, or technical problems
2. **Provide Flexible Saving:** Support both manual saves (player-controlled) and auto-saves (system-controlled) to accommodate different play styles
3. **Enable Cloud Backup:** Offer simple backup and restore functionality through cloud storage for peace of mind
4. **Maintain Performance:** Ensure saving operations don't negatively impact game performance or user experience
5. **Support Multiple Saves:** Allow players to maintain 3-5 distinct save slots for different playthroughs or experimentation

## User Stories

**As a casual player**, I want the game to auto-save my progress so that I don't lose my advancement when I close the browser unexpectedly.

**As a dedicated player**, I want to manually save my game at important moments so that I can return to specific points if needed.

**As a player who switches devices**, I want to backup my save to the cloud so that I can continue my progress on any device.

**As a cautious player**, I want multiple save slots so that I can keep backup saves in case something goes wrong with my main save.

**As a returning player**, I want to easily restore my cloud save when I return to the game after a long break.

**As an experimenting player**, I want separate save slots so that I can try different character builds or story choices without losing my main progress.

## Functional Requirements

### Local Save System
1. The system must automatically save player progress every 2-3 minutes during active gameplay
2. The system must automatically save when the player completes significant actions (level up, area transition, quest completion)
3. The system must allow players to manually save their game through a "Save Game" button in the menu
4. The system must support 3-5 distinct save slots, each storing a complete game state
5. The system must display save slot information including: character name, level, current area, playtime, and last saved timestamp
6. The system must allow players to load any existing save slot through a "Load Game" menu
7. The system must store save data in browser localStorage for persistence across sessions
8. The system must handle localStorage quota limits gracefully with appropriate user messaging

### Cloud Save Integration
9. The system must allow players to create accounts using email/password authentication
10. The system must enable players to backup their local save slots to cloud storage
11. The system must allow players to restore cloud saves to local save slots
12. The system must integrate with a Database-as-a-Service solution (Firebase or Supabase)
13. The system must sync save data including: player stats, inventory, captured monsters, story progress, area unlocks, settings, and UI preferences
14. The system must handle network connectivity issues gracefully with retry mechanisms and offline queuing
15. The system must provide clear status indicators for cloud save operations (uploading, syncing, complete, failed)

### Data Management
16. The system must save all game data including: player statistics, inventory items, captured monsters, story flags, completed quests, area unlock status, game settings, and UI preferences
17. The system must compress save data to minimize storage requirements and transfer times
18. The system must validate save data integrity before saving and loading operations
19. The system must handle save data corruption gracefully with recovery options when possible
20. The system must maintain save data format versioning for future compatibility

### User Interface
21. The system must provide a dedicated Save/Load menu accessible from the main menu and pause screen
22. The system must display visual confirmation when save operations complete successfully
23. The system must show loading indicators during save and load operations
24. The system must provide clear error messages when save operations fail
25. The system must allow players to rename their save files with custom names

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multiplayer Save Sharing:** This feature will not include the ability to share save files between different players or collaborative gameplay elements
2. **Save File Encryption:** Advanced security features like save file encryption are not included in this initial implementation
3. **Save File Versioning/History:** The system will not maintain multiple versions or historical snapshots of save files
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Initial version will focus on web browsers only, not mobile apps or desktop clients

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Database-as-a-Service Integration:** Implement using Firebase Firestore or Supabase for cloud storage
- **Authentication:** Use Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth for simple email/password user management
- **Data Serialization:** Use JSON format with compression (gzip) for save data storage
- **State Management:** Integrate with existing ReactGameContext for seamless save/load operations
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for network issues, storage limits, and data corruption

### Implementation Notes
- Save operations should be non-blocking and provide user feedback
- Consider implementing a save queue system for handling multiple concurrent save requests
- Use React hooks pattern consistent with existing codebase architecture
- Integrate with existing `useSaveLoad` hook structure already present in the codebase
- Ensure save data includes all state from ReactGameContext including player, world, inventory, monsters, and settings

### Dependencies
- Firebase SDK or Supabase SDK for cloud storage and authentication
- Compression library for save data optimization
- Integration with existing React Context and hooks system

## Success Metrics

1. **Save Success Rate:** 99%+ successful save operations (both local and cloud)
2. **User Adoption:** 70%+ of active players create and use cloud saves within first month
3. **Progress Retention:** Reduce player-reported progress loss incidents to near zero
4. **Performance Impact:** Save operations complete within 2 seconds for local saves, 5 seconds for cloud saves
5. **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback on save system reliability and ease of use

## Open Questions

1. Should there be a maximum cloud storage limit per player account?
2. How should we handle players who want to delete their cloud account and all associated data?
3. Should we implement automatic conflict resolution when local and cloud saves differ?
4. Do we need to implement save data export/import functionality for advanced users?
5. Should the system include save file sharing capabilities for community features in the future?
