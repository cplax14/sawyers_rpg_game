# Shop Loading Fix Summary

## Problem
Shops were not appearing in the game. Console showed:
- "No shops - missing currentArea.shopIds or loadedShops"
- `shopIds: undefined` for starting_village
- `loadedShopsCount: 0` (shops not loading)

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Window Exports
The shop data files (`shops.js` and `shop-inventory.js`) were only exporting for Node.js modules but not making data available globally for browser usage.

**Files affected:**
- `/public/data/shops.js`
- `/public/data/shop-inventory.js`

### 2. Shop Location Mismatch
The `mistwood_general_store` had `location: "mistwood_forest"` but was assigned to `starting_village` in the shopIds array.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Add Window Exports to shops.js
**File:** `/public/data/shops.js`

Added global window export after the module.exports:

```javascript
// Export for use in game
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = { ShopData };
}

// Make available globally for browser
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.ShopData = ShopData;
}
```

### Fix 2: Add Window Exports to shop-inventory.js
**File:** `/public/data/shop-inventory.js`

Added global window export after the module.exports:

```javascript
// Export for use in game
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = { ShopInventoryData };
}

// Make available globally for browser
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.ShopInventoryData = ShopInventoryData;
}
```

### Fix 3: Correct Shop Location
**File:** `/public/data/shops.js`

Changed the mistwood_general_store location:

```javascript
mistwood_general_store: {
    id: "mistwood_general_store",
    name: "Rosie's Remedies & Rarities",
    type: "general",
    location: "starting_village",  // Changed from "mistwood_forest"
    // ... rest of shop definition
}
```

## Verification

### Test Results
Created test page at `/public/test-shop-load.html` which verified:
- ‚úÖ `window.ShopData` exists with 7 shops
- ‚úÖ `mistwood_general_store` found with correct location
- ‚úÖ `window.ShopInventoryData` exists with 7 inventories
- ‚úÖ `starting_village` has `shopIds: ["mistwood_general_store"]`

### In-Game Testing
Navigated to Peaceful Village (starting_village) and confirmed:
- ‚úÖ Shop data loads: `üè™ Loaded shops: 7`
- ‚úÖ Shop filtered for area: `üè™ Filtered shops for area: 1 [mistwood_general_store]`
- ‚úÖ Shop auto-discovered: `üè™ Auto-discovering shop in town: Rosie's Remedies & Rarities`
- ‚úÖ Shop auto-unlocked: `üîì Shop unlocked: mistwood_general_store`
- ‚úÖ **Shop button appears in UI**: "üè™ Mistwood General Store"

## Expected Behavior Now

When players enter Peaceful Village (starting_village):
1. The AreaExploration component loads all shop data from `window.ShopData`
2. Filters shops to find those with IDs in `currentArea.shopIds`
3. Auto-discovers and auto-unlocks shops in town-type areas
4. Displays shop buttons in the Services section
5. Players can click the shop button to enter the shop (functionality to be implemented in later tasks)

## Files Modified
1. `/public/data/shops.js` - Added window export and fixed location
2. `/public/data/shop-inventory.js` - Added window export
3. `/public/test-shop-load.html` - Created test verification page

## Related Files (Unchanged but Verified)
- `/public/data/areas.js` - Confirmed `starting_village` has correct `shopIds`
- `/src/utils/dataLoader.ts` - Confirmed `loadShopData()` reads from `window.ShopData`
- `/src/components/organisms/AreaExploration.tsx` - Confirmed shop loading logic works
- `/index.html` - Confirmed shop data files are loaded via script tags

## Next Steps
The shop loading system is now fully functional. Next task should focus on:
- Implementing the shop UI component when players click the shop button
- Adding buy/sell functionality
- Implementing shop inventory management
