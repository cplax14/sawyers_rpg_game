# Architecture Consolidation

## Changes Made

The application has been consolidated to use the **Pure React** architecture as the primary entry point.

### What Changed

1. **Primary Entry Point**: Now uses `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `ReactApp.tsx`
2. **Combat System**: Uses `ReactCombat` component with `ReactGameContext` for proper post-victory modals and inventory accumulation
3. **Single App**: No more multiple versions running simultaneously

### Archived Files

The following files have been moved to preserve the old hybrid approach:

- `index-hybrid-backup.html` - Old hybrid React/Vanilla approach
- `src/main-hybrid-backup.tsx` - Old hybrid entry point
- `src/App-hybrid-backup.tsx` - Old hybrid App component

### Current Architecture

- **Main Entry**: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `ReactApp.tsx`
- **Combat**: `ReactCombat.tsx` with proper victory modals and reward distribution
- **Inventory**: `ReactInventoryScreen.tsx` with real-time updates
- **State Management**: `ReactGameContext.tsx` with complete game state and combat rewards
- **Test Panel**: `ReactTestPanel.tsx` (development only) for testing combat flow

### Testing

Visit `http://localhost:3002/` and use the React Test Panel in the top-right to:
1. Create Test Player
2. Start Test Combat
3. Verify victory modal shows with rewards
4. Check inventory accumulates items properly

The Pure React approach is now the single source of truth for the application.
